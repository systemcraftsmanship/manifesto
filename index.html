  <p style="margin-bottom: 3rem;">
    As aspiring System Crafters we are raising the bar of professional system and infrastructure development even further, by extending <b>Software Craftsmanship</b> movement, to create more value in the DevOps ecosystem. Through this work we have come to value:
  </p>
  <h2>Not only well-crafted software, but also <font color="#841212">well-crafted infrastructure</font></h2>
  <h3>Not only responding to change, but also steadily adding value</h3>
  <h3>Not only individuals and interactions, but also a community of professionals</h3>
  <h3>Not only customer collaboration, but also productive partnerships</h3>
  <p style="margin-top: 3rem;">That is, in pursuit of the items that <a href="https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/">the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto</a> has, we have found the extension of the first item indispensible.</p>
